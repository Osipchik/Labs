In computer programming, programming languages are often colloquially classified as to whether the language's type system makes it strongly typed or weakly typed (loosely typed).
Generally, a strongly typed language has stricter typing rules at compile time,
 which implies that errors and exceptions are more likely to happen during compilation. 
Dynamically typed languages (where type checking happens at run time) can also be strongly typed.
 Most of these rules affect variable assignment, return values and function calling.
